def create_doctor_appointment(request):
    """
    Handles the creation of a new doctor appointment for a registered patient.

    This view allows a logged-in patient to create a doctor appointment. The view first
    verifies that the user is registered as a patient, ensuring only patients can make
    appointments. If the request is a POST, it processes the form data to create an
    appointment.

    If the form data is valid:
        - It associates the appointment with the current patient.
        - It checks if the patient has any previous appointments with the selected doctor.
          If not, it increments the doctor's `no_of_patients` by one.
        - It increments the doctorâ€™s `no_of_appointments` by one, regardless of whether the
          patient is new to this doctor.
        - The appointment is saved to the database and a success message is displayed.
        - The user is redirected to the list of their appointments.

    Args:
        request (HttpRequest): The request object containing metadata about the request.

    Returns:
        HttpResponse:
            - If the request is POST and form submission is successful, redirects to the
              "doctor-appointment-list-for-patient" view.
            - If the request is GET or form submission fails, renders the appointment
              creation form with any validation errors displayed.
